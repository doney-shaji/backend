# Log Monitoring Project (Backend)

This project is the backend component of the Log Monitoring Project, which utilizes ReactJS for the frontend and Django for the backend. This repository specifically contains the backend server.

## Getting Started

To get started with the backend server, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/log-monitoring-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd log-monitoring-backend
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - For Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Run the Server

1. Start the Django development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The server will run at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Usage

Once the server is up and running, you can interact with the Log Monitoring Project's backend API. However, to use the frontend interface, please refer to the separate "frontend_log_monitor" repository for frontend setup and usage instructions.
